# Data Directory

## Overview

The `data` directory contains output files generated from the scientific computation codes. These files are in `.dat` or `.csv` format and are used for further analysis and visualization.

## File Naming Convention

Each data file corresponds to a specific code file in the `src` directory. The naming convention is as follows:
- **Source Code File**: `example_code.cpp`
- **Output Data Files**: `example_code.dat`, `example_code.csv`

## File Descriptions

- **`.dat` Files**: Data files in `.dat` format generated by running the C++ source code. These files are typically used for simple data storage.
- **`.csv` Files**: Data files in `.csv` format generated by running the C++ source code. These files are useful for compatibility with spreadsheet software and data analysis tools.

## Examples

- `example_code.dat`: Contains data generated by `example_code.cpp` in a space-separated format.
- `example_code.csv`: Contains data generated by `example_code.cpp` in a comma-separated format.

## Usage

1. **Accessing Data**:
   - Navigate to the `data` directory to view or download the output files.

2. **Analyzing Data**:
   - Use data analysis tools or scripts to process the `.dat` or `.csv` files.

## Notes

- Ensure that the data files are consistent with the corresponding source code files.
- The data format is designed to be compatible with GNU Plot for visualization.
